# Environment Variables

Files in this directory are used by automation scripts to store and load env vars, e.g. `config/scripts/term.conf` is used by the `sh/themecli` script. Assign path to this config file to the `_CLI_CONF` global var in `themecli` script.

| Configuration                                          | Script      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `CLI_CONF` global var containing path to config file   | `themecli`  |
| `SHELL_CONF` global var containing path to config file | `themegtk`  |
| `SHELL_CONF` global var containing path to config file | `themepop<` |
